# This project is still in progress.

This project is intended to be a one-player command line Blackjack game against a computer. It is still a work in progress.
I started this project about a year ago, and set it aside for a while. Now, as I look at it again, I am a little horified by
some elements of its design, and I need to go back and adjust a lot of it. 

# I do not recommend running any of these Python scripts at this time!
